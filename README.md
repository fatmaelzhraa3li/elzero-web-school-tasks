knowledge library

This is a simple website for a library named "knowledge library", made using HTML and CSS.

The video shows how the website looks:
- Menu with: About me – Sections – Authors – Contact us
- Book sections like Novels and Psychology
- Clear layout with pictures and text

It's a small project to learn and practice front-end design.
